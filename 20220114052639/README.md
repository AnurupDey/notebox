# Shell Pattern Matching

Shell Pattern Matching are expressions that are used to help match
patterns while using interactive shells like bash. These Expressions are
also used while scripting, in places like [Bash Case Statements][1].

They are not the same as [Regular Expressions][2].

eg:
```sh
cd ws*.host.com/[Yy]es.*
```

* They are also known as **Glob Patterns**
