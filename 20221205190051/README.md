# Components of a Zettelkasten

1. Wooden boxes which have drawers that can be pulled open. This is just a physical space to store the notes.
1. Pieces of paper (about half of a letter sized sheet). Notes will be written only on one side of the paper, so that the notes can be read without taking the paper out of the boxes, to some extent. Luhmann recommends normal thin paper instead of thick card paper, in order to be able to fit more notes in the boxes.
