# Use Project Issues for TODO items and features

As a rule, use a project's dedicated "Issue Tracker" any notes relating
to the project. These notes may include:

* TODOs relating to that particular project
* Feature Ideas.
* Bugs that get discovered.
* General Notes and Thoughts relating to that specific project,
  (Including thoughts that pop up randomly) 

Advantages:

* Keeps all ideas related to the project close to the project in most
  cases. 
* Can Separately shared with people very quickly

Github Issues, Gitlab Issues, etc are examples
