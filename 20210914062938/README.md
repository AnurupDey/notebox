# Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)

`PGP` is a security and privacy system, achieved via public key cryptography.

It can be used for the following purposes:
* Encryption: Scrambling data so that no one other than the intended receiver
  can decode.
* Signing: Providing proof that data that appears to have originated from the
  sender is in fact from the sender and has not been tampered with.
* Verifying Signatures: Making sure that data is being received not tampered
  with and from the correct sender.
