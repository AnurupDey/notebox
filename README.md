**About**

A repository of personal notes on various topics linked together.
Meant to be a dump of ideas, notes related to topics that I personally research,
or just bits of information that I want to look up very quickly later in time. 

Notes are allowed to be added ad hoc without structure as they happen, however 
they happen. 

Hopefully this repo eventually reflects all my knowledge and acts as a second brain.

It's convenient to work with this repo with the `nb` tool[^1].
