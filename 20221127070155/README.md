# Sources of emotional stress

There is emotional pressure that our environment and the way we interact
with it that comes in ($S_incomming$).

This incomming pressure has parts that can be avoided ($S_contolable$)
and parts that can not be avoided ($S_uncontrollable$).

Part of this incomming pressure one is able to handle or cope with ($C$)

*The emotional stress one feels ($S$)is the amount of incomming pressure that
they cannot cope with.*

A person's coping ability is based on three factors

* A person's personality that cannot be retrained ($P_fixed$)
* A person's personality that can be retrained/adjusted ($P_maliable$)
* Ability of a person enhanced by tools and techniques ($T$)

$$S = S_incomming - C$$

$$S_incomming = S_controllable + S_uncontrollable$$
$$C = P_fixed + P_maliable + T$$
