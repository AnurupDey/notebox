# Sources of emotional stress

There is emotional pressure that our environment and the way we interact
with it that comes in ( $S_{incomming}$ ).

This incomming pressure has parts that can be avoided ( $S_{contollable}$ )
and parts that can not be avoided ( $S_{uncontrollable}$ ).

Part of this incomming pressure one is able to handle or cope with ( $C$ )

*The emotional stress one feels* ( $S$ ) *is the amount of incomming pressure that
they cannot cope with.*

A person's coping ability is based on three factors

* A person's personality that cannot be retrained ( $P_{fixed}$ )
* A person's personality that can be retrained/adjusted ( $P_{maliable}$ )
* Ability of a person enhanced by tools and techniques ( $T$ )

$$S = S_{incomming} - C$$

$$S_{incomming} = S_{controllable} + S_{uncontrollable}$$

$$C = P_{fixed} + P_{maliable} + T$$
