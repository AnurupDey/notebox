# Zettelkasten Compass

This is a technique to systematically come up with plausible links to other ideas or forming new ideas while using the Zettelkasten Method.

Given a note, think about the four cardinal directions:

* North - think about where the idea comes from
* West - think about what idea is most similar
* East - think about what idea is the opposite of this idea
* South - what's next, what can be built on top of this idea

```
                    North
                (Where from)
                     /|\
                      |
  West   <----------Idea----------->   East
(Similar)             |             (Opposite)
                     \|/
                    South
                  (Where to)
```
