# Writing is required for complex thought formation

Niklas Luhmann in a paper describing his note-taking method says that "It is impossible to think without writing; at least it is impossible in any sophisticated of *networked* fashion."

He goes on to mention that "we must mark *differences*, and capture distinctions which are either implicitly or explicitly contained in concepts. Only if we have secured in this way the constancy of the schema that produces information, can the consistency of the subsequent processes of processing information be guaranteed."
