# Organizing notes in a Zettelkasten

There are two ways one can organise notes.

> If a communicative system is to hold together for a longer period, we must choose either the rout of highly technical specialization or that of incorporating randomness and information generated ad hoc.
-- Niklas Luhmann[^1]

This leads either

1. Thematic specialization of notes, where all the notes are regarding a single topic
1. Open organization of notes, no set topic

Luhmann chooses to use the latter. Hence, a Zettelkasten may contain notes on any and all topics without restrictions.
