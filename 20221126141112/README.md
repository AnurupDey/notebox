# Searching for KEG repositories on Github

An easy way to look for KEG comminity members to follow would be to
search Github for repositories that contain the `keg` file which follow
the KEG specification. 

Checking for specification conformance is a second step, but the first
step would be to find such repos

```
filename:keg$
```

The above should show KEG repos as the top results
