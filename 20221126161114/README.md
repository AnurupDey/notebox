# Mindfully Browsing YouTube

Here is a technique for mindfully browsing a feed generated by a
recommendation algorithm like YouTube's, which limits mindless scrolling
and keeps one aware of the time going into watching videos.

1. Set aside a **scrolling time**. This is the time allowed to be spent
   scrolling the *main* content feed. (recommend 5 mins)
1. Use the **scrolling time** to add videos that peek interest to the
   **Watch Later** playlist.
1. Decide how much time you are going to spend actually watching.
1. Watch only from the **Watch Later** playlist until time is up.
1. Remove the videos you watch from the **Watch Later** playlist.

This does require a lot of discipline, might think of making browser
plugins to help enforce this idea.
