<p>When working in a collaborative project where part of your team is either not familiar with Version Control Systems like <code>git</code> or they refuse to use such tools for some reason, it can be a hassle to incorporate changes made by other team members into the copy of files that you are working on.</p>
<p>Maintaining a <code>git</code> repository of the files at your end helps in collaboration even in this case.</p>
<p>I use the following set of branches: * <code>upstream</code> - upstream changes are added here. This branchâ€™s history will reflect just the upstream changes, which is sometimes useful. * <code>integration/clean</code> - This branch is where I clean and reformat the files received from upstream. Kind of like a merging point of the upstream files and the files I am working with. * <code>integration/IO</code> - This is the branch that will contain my changes. Name this what you want. * <code>main</code> - stable branch to contain tagged releases.</p>
<p>When upstream changes are to be merged with your local version, which may have your own changes made locally, you can</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Add the upstream changes to <code>upstream</code> via copy paste.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch to <code>integration/clean</code>, then merge <code>upstream</code> into the current branch. (I prefer using a <code>--no-ff</code> merge to keep histories separate.)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If a merge is messy, you can also replace a file on the current branch with a version from the <code>upstream</code> branch completely without questions using</p>
